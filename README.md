# PIC10C-Final
 
## A turn-based strategy game made for PIC10C at UCLA using Qt Creator.

### Cursor is controlled with the Z, X, and arrow keys. Player plays as blue, computer plays as red. Move the cursor and select units with Z. Selected units will show their movement options. Selecting one of these squares will move the unit to this location and display attack options for adjacent enemy units and a wait option, selecting oneself. Selecting an adjacent tile will attack the unit. The units with a combat advantage will survive, meaning stalemates will result in both units being destroyed. Combat advantages: Axe beats lance, lance beats sword, sword beats axe. The game is over when either team loses all units.
